5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what doesn't work?

Yes, but it took me a really long time...

6. Did you successfully implement live updates? If not, what doesn't work?

Not really. I thought it should work since I did all the required steps following the documentation, but it still didn’t have the live updates.


7. Did Prof. Tuck give you any alternate / additional goals for this assignment?
   If so, what were they and how well did you complete them with your submission?

Yes. My goal is to get likes and live updates working and have better understanding of the phoenix structure. I got likes working and live updates somehow didn’t work. I did have better understanding of the phoenix structure now.


8. Is there any other useful information that you want to provide for grading?
Though my live updates didn’t work, I put a lot of efforts on it. Please understand me and don’t penalize me too much!!!Thank you!!!!
